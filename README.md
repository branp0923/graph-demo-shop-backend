# Graph Demo - Shop Backend

Minimal backend-style repo to exercise graph searching:
- API -> services -> models -> jobs/reporting
- Cross-module imports, constants, and shared utilities
- Tests referencing production code

Key use cases:
- Rename a model field (e.g., `Order.total_cents`)
- Trace a service function through API + jobs + reports
